For lab4.s we used pair programming with one person coding and the other person checking/instructing, alternating roles every 15 minutes.
Since we worked on the lab on different days Both people incorporated their DE1-SOC boards and IntelFPGA Monitor Programs. 
Both people were present during the git and push process on Pouyaâ€™s computer.
And the entire lab was completed in person while both members were present.
